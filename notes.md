# Gameplay
- Local multiplayer with 2-4 player support
- Players vie for control of multiple zones in a cityscape

## Zone control
- Players can capture a zone by staying within its boundaries for a set duration
- Once captured, players earn points over time for each zone they control
- Zones can be contested; if an opposing player enters a controlled zone, a timer starts
- If the opposing player remains in the zone for a set duration, control switches to them

## Victory conditions
- The game ends after a fixed time limit (e.g., 10 minutes)
- The player with the most points at the end of the time limit wins
