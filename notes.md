# Graphics
- 2.5D sprite-based graphics
- Urban cityscape environment

# Gameplay
- Local multiplayer with 2-4 player support
- Each player controls a single character 
- Players acquire a mask that does two things:
  1. Grants a unique (combat) ability
  2. Allows access to a (pre-set) number of objectives
- The core gameplay loop consists of walking to objectives and completing them (presumably just by standing next to them) and frustrating the 
attempts of other players at achieving their objectives

## Victory conditions
- The game ends after a fixed time limit (e.g., 10 minutes)
- The player with the most points at the end of the time limit wins

## Mask Abilities
- All players start without a mask
- Masks spawn randomly on the map
- Each mask grants a unique ability
- (Possible) mask types:
  - ✅ Arson
  - ✅ Knife
  - ✅ Gun
  - Beefy
  - Prank
  - Fast
  - Stealth
  - Trap
  - Theft
